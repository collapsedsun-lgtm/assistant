                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
 with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
 you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 and/or modify the software.

  When a program is run on a server and users interact with it there,
 the server-side users can be deprived of the right to get the source
 code of the software running on the server.  The GNU General Public
 License does not require source code to be made available to such
 users.  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed to ensure
 that the source code of modified versions of such a program is made
 available to the users of the server.

  This version of the License permits making a modified version and
 running it on a server, but requires that the modified source be
 offered to the users of that server.  It also requires that the
 licensee convey the corresponding source code to the users.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
if it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License,
and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a
user request for permission to propagate the work, such as to install a
plugin, the interface must also display a convenient and prominently
visible URL for the full text of this License.  The Copyright Notice and
the appropriate notices required by this paragraph may be embedded in
the "help" or other documentation provided with the interface.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form
of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
protected material outside their relationship with you.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or under
any similar law prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy
of this License along with the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you changed
  the files and the date of any change.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
  released under this License and any conditions added under section
  7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
  "keep intact all notices".

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
  License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
  License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
  additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
  regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
  permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
  invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
  Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
  work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
  Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
  used for software interchange.

  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
  offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
  offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
  anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
  Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
  covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
  for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
  cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
  to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
  written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative
  is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
  received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
  subsection 6b.

  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
  place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
  Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
  further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
  Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
  copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
  may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that
  supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
  directions next to the object code saying where to find the
  Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
  Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
  available for as long as necessary to satisfy these requirements.

  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source
  of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
  subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from this
  License; or

  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
  author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
  Notices displayed by works containing it; or

  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
  requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
  reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
  authors; or

  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
  trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

  f) Requiring indemnity from licensors and authors of that material
  for claims brought against you by third parties (however, this is not
  an endorsement of such indemnity requirements).

Other than as expressly stated above, additional terms, whether
included in the Program or added by you, may not be applied to the
entire Program.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it,
contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along
with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by propagating or modifying a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patents.
